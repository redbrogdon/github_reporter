# GitHub PR Report for flutter/website
## From 2025-11-07

This period's updates focused on enhancing developer tooling and improving the documentation experience. The documentation for the experimental Widget Previewer was updated for the Flutter 3.38 release, detailing new features such as IDE integration and custom preview annotations ([PR #12649](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12649)). The documentation site itself was improved with the addition of interactive glossary tooltips, allowing users to view definitions on hover without leaving the page ([PR #12654](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12654)). For DevTools, release notes were published for versions 2.51.1 and 2.52.0, with the latter introducing resizable columns, horizontal scrolling, and Network profiler UI improvements ([PR #12652](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12652), [PR #12659](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12659)). Finally, the architectural overview documentation was refined to remove outdated information regarding the web hot reload flag ([PR #12657](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12657)) and a dead footnote ([PR #12658](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12658)).
