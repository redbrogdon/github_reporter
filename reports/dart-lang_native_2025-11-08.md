# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/native
## From 2025-11-07

This period marked a significant maturation for Dart's native interoperability features. A major highlight was the graduation of several packages to stable releases: the `hooks`, `code_assets`, and `hooks_runner` packages reached their 1.0.0 version in [PR #2758](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2758), and Objective-C interop is now also considered stable, with its experimental status notice removed in [PR #2757](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2757). In the Java interop space, the `jni` and `jnigen` packages were updated in [PR #2756](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2756), which introduced several breaking changes to the public API, including making `Jni.env` internal. Finally, general code health was improved through the removal of redundant `ignore_for_file` comments across the `ffigen` ([PR #2751](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2751)) and `objective_c` ([PR #2752](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2752)) packages.
