# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/language
## From 2025-11-07

This period saw focused work on refining an upcoming Dart language feature. The proposal for 'Private named parameters' received a wording adjustment in [PR #4561](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/pull/4561) to clarify the scope of a parameter's public and private names. The update specifies that the public name is intended for use only at call sites, not within the constructor's own implementation, thus improving the precision of the feature's specification.

# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/native
## From 2025-11-07

This period marked a significant maturation for Dart's native interoperability features. A major highlight was the graduation of several packages to stable releases: the `hooks`, `code_assets`, and `hooks_runner` packages reached their 1.0.0 version in [PR #2758](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2758), and Objective-C interop is now also considered stable, with its experimental status notice removed in [PR #2757](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2757). In the Java interop space, the `jni` and `jnigen` packages were updated in [PR #2756](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2756), which introduced several breaking changes to the public API, including making `Jni.env` internal. Finally, general code health was improved through the removal of redundant `ignore_for_file` comments across the `ffigen` ([PR #2751](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2751)) and `objective_c` ([PR #2752](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2752)) packages.

# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/sdk
## From 2025-11-07

This period focused on bug fixes and stability, with no new pull requests merged. Key progress was made on language features and interoperability, including the resolution of an issue related to handling union types in `js_interop` ([#61919](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61919)). A bug affecting generic function instantiation with inherited members and extension methods was also fixed ([#61914](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61914)). Other work included addressing a false-negative in the `parameter_assignments` lint ([#61175](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61175)) and fixing test failures in `dart2js` ([#61833](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61833)) and `dart:ffi` ([#61733](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61733)), contributing to the overall robustness of the SDK.

# GitHub PR Report for flutter/flutter
## From 2025-11-07

This period saw several significant enhancements to the Flutter framework's public API and tooling. Most notably, the `HapticFeedback` class was expanded with methods for success, warning, and error notifications ([PR #177721](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/177721)), resolving a highly requested feature ([Issue #150029](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/150029)). State preservation in lists was improved with a fix for `ListView.separated` and `SliverList.separated` that introduces a new `findItemIndexCallback`, deprecating the old callback to correctly account for separators ([PR #174491](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174491)). For Android developers, a new `disable-abi-filtering` flag gives more control over build configurations by allowing custom Gradle `abiFilters` to be respected ([PR #177753](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/177753)). Other key updates include the addition of `InputDecoration.maintainLabelSize` to prevent label truncation in `InputDecorator` intrinsic width calculations ([PR #178101](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178101)), a fix for a tool crash caused by invalid UTF-8 characters from ADB logs ([PR #178170](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178170)), and an engine-level migration to Skia's modern `SkPathBuilder` API ([PR #178142](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178142)).

## Merged Pull Requests

### [PR #178170](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178170): [ Tool ] Ignore invalid UTF-8 from ADB's stdout
* **Author:** [bkonyi](https://github.com/bkonyi)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 3
* **Summary:** This pull request fixes a regression in the Flutter tool's Android log reader by ignoring invalid UTF-8 characters from the ADB `stdout` stream, which prevents the tool from crashing when processing malformed logcat data.

### [PR #178142](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178142): Reland "Update all uses of mutable SkPath methods to use SkPathBuilder"
* **Author:** [jason-simmons](https://github.com/jason-simmons)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 0
* **Summary:** Replaces all uses of Skia's mutable `SkPath` methods with the modern `SkPathBuilder` API throughout the engine. This change aligns with upstream Skia recommendations and adds the `SK_HIDE_PATH_EDIT_METHODS` build flag to prevent future use of the legacy API.

### [PR #178101](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178101): Allow label to be used to compute InputDecorator Intrinsic width
* **Author:** [bleroux](https://github.com/bleroux)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 1
* **Summary:** Adds `InputDecoration.maintainLabelSize`, a new property that, when enabled, includes the label's width in the `InputDecorator`'s intrinsic width calculation to prevent the label from being truncated.

### [PR #178078](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178078): [web] Remove unnecessary android_sdk dep
* **Author:** [mdebbar](https://github.com/mdebbar)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 1
* **Summary:** Removes the unnecessary `android_sdk` and `open_jdk` dependencies from several web-related CI test configurations.

### 🔥 [PR #177753](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/177753): Respect product flavor abiFilters by adding a `disable-abi-filtering` Android project flag.
* **Author:** [mboetger](https://github.com/mboetger)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 6
* **Summary:** Introduces a `disable-abi-filtering` flag for Android builds that prevents the Flutter tool from applying default ABI filters, allowing developers' custom `abiFilters` in Gradle product flavors to be respected.

### [PR #177721](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/177721): Add haptic notifications support.
* **Author:** [ksokolovskyi](https://github.com/ksokolovskyi)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 3
* **Summary:** Adds `successNotification`, `warningNotification`, and `errorNotification` methods to the `HapticFeedback` class, allowing developers to trigger platform-specific haptics for these common states on iOS and Android (API 30+).

### [PR #177313](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/177313): Fix text input actions in DropdownMenu.
* **Author:** [ksokolovskyi](https://github.com/ksokolovskyi)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 3
* **Summary:** Fixes an issue where `TextInputAction` was not correctly handled in `DropdownMenu` by moving the submission logic to `onSubmitted` and wrapping menu items with `ExcludeFocus` to allow for proper focus traversal.

### 🔥 [PR #174491](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174491): fix: findChildIndexCallback to take seperators into account for seperated named constructor in ListView and SliverList
* **Author:** [rkishan516](https://github.com/rkishan516)
* **Merged At:** 2025-11-07
* **Comments:** 6
* **Summary:** Fixes state preservation in `ListView.separated` and `SliverList.separated` by adding a new `findItemIndexCallback` that works with item indices, deprecating the old `findChildIndexCallback` which required developers to manually account for separators.

# GitHub PR Report for flutter/website
## From 2025-11-07

This period's updates focused on enhancing developer tooling and improving the documentation experience. The documentation for the experimental Widget Previewer was updated for the Flutter 3.38 release, detailing new features such as IDE integration and custom preview annotations ([PR #12649](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12649)). The documentation site itself was improved with the addition of interactive glossary tooltips, allowing users to view definitions on hover without leaving the page ([PR #12654](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12654)). For DevTools, release notes were published for versions 2.51.1 and 2.52.0, with the latter introducing resizable columns, horizontal scrolling, and Network profiler UI improvements ([PR #12652](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12652), [PR #12659](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12659)). Finally, the architectural overview documentation was refined to remove outdated information regarding the web hot reload flag ([PR #12657](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12657)) and a dead footnote ([PR #12658](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12658)).
