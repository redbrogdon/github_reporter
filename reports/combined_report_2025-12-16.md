# Overall Summary
### 🔥🔥🔥 [PR #175508](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175508) (flutter/flutter): Bump minSdk to `24` in `engine`
*   **Comments:** 25
*   Increases the minimum Android SDK version for the Flutter engine to 24, which simplifies the codebase by allowing the removal of conditional logic and compatibility code for older API levels.

### [Issue #175074](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/175074) (flutter/flutter): [Android Web] resizeToAvoidBottomInset broken on Android. Keyboard breaks layout.
*   **Reactions:** **22** -- 👍 22
*   This PR fixes a long-standing bug on Android web where the view was incorrectly resized when the virtual keyboard appeared. The change ensures the view's `physicalSize` remains constant while the keyboard is visible, properly accounting for the obscured area via `viewInsets`.

### [PR #2855](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2855) (dart-lang/native): [ffigen] Add setters for dart-style enum members for structs
*   **Comments:** 5
*   Adds setters for enum members in structs generated by `ffigen`, allowing developers to directly assign enum values to struct fields instead of manually setting the underlying integer value.

### 🔥 [PR #178580](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178580) (flutter/flutter): Suppress deprecation warning for AChoreographer_postFrameCallback
*   **Comments:** 6
*   This PR fixes a build failure when compiling with the Android API 35 SDK by using compiler pragmas to suppress a deprecation warning for `AChoreographer_postFrameCallback`, a function still required for backward compatibility with older Android versions.

### [Issue #62110](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/62110) (dart-lang/sdk): [cfe] Option to omit details in `Source` objects from `Component.uriToSource`
*   This issue proposes adding an option to `Component.uriToSource` to omit the full source code from `Source` objects, which would reduce significant memory consumption for backends that only need metadata and not the actual source text.

### [PR #179768](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179768) (flutter/flutter): [Impeller] Delete GLES framebuffer objects only on the thread where they were created
*   **Comments:** 0
*   This PR ensures that Impeller's OpenGL backend deletes framebuffer objects only on the thread where they were created. This is required to prevent invalid cross-context operations, and is accomplished by tracking the owner thread for framebuffers and deferring their garbage collection until the reactor is running on that thread.

# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/sdk
## From 2025-12-15

This period focused on improving the stability and performance of the Dart SDK's core components and tooling. For compiler backends, an important enhancement was proposed to reduce memory consumption by adding an option to the compiler front-end to omit full source code from `Source` objects ([#62110](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/62110)). Several critical race conditions were addressed, fixing crashes in the Dart VM when invoking certain functions ([#60492](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/60492)) and null exceptions during analysis server plugin startup ([#62214](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/62214)). Finally, a tooling bug was fixed where the `dart run` command would fail when executing a remote package with a trailing `@` in the name ([#62122](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/62122)).

# GitHub PR Report for dart-lang/native
## From 2025-12-15

This period saw an important usability improvement for the `ffigen` tool. Following a feature request in issue [#2784](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues/2784), an update in pull request [#2855](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/pull/2855) now ensures that setters are generated for `dart-style` enum members within structs. This change improves the generated API surface by allowing developers to directly assign enum values to struct fields, which is more intuitive and less error-prone than manually managing the underlying integer values.

* **Author:** [Levi-Lesches](https://github.com/Levi-Lesches)
* **Reactions:** **1** -- 👍 1
* The `ffigen` code generator is not creating setters for dart-style enum members in structs; it provides a getter to read the enum value but omits the corresponding setter, preventing direct assignment.

# GitHub PR Report for flutter/flutter
## From 2025-12-15

This period's updates brought a significant change for Android developers, as the minimum required SDK version for the Flutter engine was raised to 24 in a highly-discussed pull request ([PR #175508](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175508)), simplifying the codebase by removing legacy compatibility logic. Further work on Android included suppressing a deprecation warning to ensure compatibility with the upcoming Android API 35 ([PR #178580](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/178580)) and fixing a long-standing keyboard layout bug on Android web that had garnered significant community feedback ([Issue #175074](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/175074), [PR #179581](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179581)). An attempt to improve the Android toolchain by updating the SDK bundle to a standard directory structure ([PR #179647](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179647)) was reverted after it caused CI failures ([PR #179904](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179904)). On the rendering front, the Impeller engine received stability improvements, ensuring that OpenGL framebuffer objects are deleted on the correct thread ([PR #179768](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179768)). Lastly, platform and tooling enhancements included adding `Adwaita Sans` as a font fallback on Linux to align with upcoming GNOME changes ([PR #179144](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179144)) and modifying the Widget Preview tool to prevent excessive disk usage ([PR #179821](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/179821)).

# GitHub PR Report for flutter/website
## From 2025-12-15

This period focused on improving the developer learning experience and cleaning up documentation. To help users better understand tutorial content, lessons now feature preview and review cards that summarize what will be, and what was, accomplished ([PR #12821](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12821)). In an effort to remove outdated information, the iOS deployment documentation was updated to remove a section describing how to manually update the deployment version ([PR #12805](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/12805)). This section is no longer necessary, as the build process now handles this step automatically, a change prompted by community feedback in [Issue #12800](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/12800).
