This project has three important documents that you should read and use to make decisions correctly:

* **USAGE.md**: Contains a description of what the application should do. If I tell you to add new or updated functionality to the application, make sure to update this doc to keep it current.
* **DESIGN.md**: Contains a description of the architecture and overall design of the application. If you make design or architectural decisions, update this doc to keep it current.
* **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: This doc contains a log of implementation tasks (both completed and to be completed) and notes related to the implementation. When completing tasks, make sure to update this file with notes and to mark those tasks as completed.
